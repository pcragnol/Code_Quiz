# Code_Quiz

## Description
For this project I created a ten-question multiple choice JavaScript quiz. The goal for this project was to create a dynamic web page that runs several functions in response to various user inputs. My previous project, Password Generator, only interacted with users with JavaScript popup boxes. This quiz goes a step further by utilizing buttons and text inputs on the page itself.

A major lesson I learned in this project was how often I had to enable and disable buttons and inputs throughout the code. Disabling elements not only keeps the user on the right path to play the game, but also prevents unforeseen errors resulting from calling functions in an unexpected order.

If I revisit this project in the future, I would add a leaderboard that ranks past games by score and retains that data when the page is refreshed, and also shuffle the order of the questions and their answers.
